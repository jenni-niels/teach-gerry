One way to see and identify possible issues of inequality in access to voting is through maps and analyzing spatial data. This module contains a series of lesson plans for making and using maps of Census Data to study demographic patterns, voting districts, and access to polling places. No previous background with mapping or geographic information systems (GIS) is required, although links to resources where students can learn more are included. 

These materials were developed for the 2019 [Voting Rights Data Institute](https://sites.tufts.edu/vrdi/). Each day can be taught as a two hour lesson or they can be combined.
